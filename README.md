Air BnB Clone Project
Project Description

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles

interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.


Description of the command interprete

The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:

show
create
destroy
count
